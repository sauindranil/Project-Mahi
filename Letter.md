Hi Hiranmoy, Arka, Milan,

After a long time, there is some serious things to talk about. I am starting with why I am writing instead of calling you and disscuss.

Let me first hit you guys with two questions- 
Ever Felt lack of existence?
Ever felt lack of thoughfulness?

Existence can be of anythings like friends, family, love, peace, knowledge, work, passion.
Thoughtfulness, A sense of presence of information, presence of self existence in situations, statements, debates, sense of right or wrong. It can be anything. 

If the answer is Yes, This letter is for you guys.
Take a pen and Paper and please note that answer down. I am serious.

For a long time I have thought there are so many things we guys did together, so many plans we made earlier, but many of those were unexecuted. What could possibly be the reason behind it.

-I think Time and Knowledge.

We guys speak about Team, Team efforts, Combining our knowledge to stand a chance to make it work. Yes Team comes in between Time and Knowledge.

I am writing this instead of calling and speaking, because this way I can Convey my message better i think. The way the world, the economy, the society is going to change, will affect each and every single human being in this planet. And already people are dying of the COVID-19 disease. Moreover, people are losing their jobs, thier way of living, their inspiration of living. 

You all know about the phrase - "Survival of the fittest".
Today it is time to be the fittest of all, or at least try to be the finest and fittest of all. I am starting a Project, an attempt, a major duty I should do for myself first, then for you guys also. 

How clear are you about the things I am listing below plz give a rating on 10 and write that down:

Your Identity.
Your Passion.
Your Needs.
Your Negetive Thoughts.
Your Knowledge.

Let me tell you about the motive behind all these:
Power
Knowledge
Clarity of Mind
Self-satisfaction

These three things lies inside every human being, but I am thriving for each one of these. Why? Ask youself. Don't you want to do the things you are not doing only because of you are not in a situation where you hold enough power, knowledge, clarity of your doings? I am not having a greater peak of knowledge in me what is needed. I am not having that much power in me by which I can do some good to Humanity. 

Each and every step towards growth, prosperity, knowledge, creation, starts from commitment.
commitment to youself.
commitment to gain.
To Gain Knowledge, Skills.
To Connect the dots, whatever is not there.

Nowadays I feel Like there is too much of  information, information what can build you, and information that can destroy your creativity,your attitude, your perception. I am having many thoughts over and over again of "flow of information in Human beings". 

Think of your childhood,
Close Your Eyes and Think after Reading this:
Whatever you are now, what you've become, all of this happened because of information, habits, time, knowledge, surroundings, your habits and your limited knowledge.

I am telling you to see the flow of time and the person you have become over time as an influence of situations, good or bad, think about it, think about the level of knowledge you had at that time.

Now Open Your Eyes.
That was really a journey nahh!!! Haha!! I know.

Now Close Your Eyes Again and Think after Reading this:
Think of a better version, sorry , best version of yourself you can think of.
Think those situations that affected you in the past while growing. Think of the situations that stop you from evolving into a superself at that time. Relate flow of information and Knowledge in those thoughts. If you got knowledge and information back then, where are you seeing yourself now.

Now Open your eyes and Do tell one true thing to yourself- Did you find yourself in a greater position than where you are Now??????

I think Yes.
So if you guys also felt that need of knowledge, that need of power, that need of clarity, I am calling you all to join hands in this mission.

Let us Find ourselves from the root to the leaves till we grow to our fullest.

PROJECT LOG#1
Guys if you feel this bullshit you can quit.
But if you fell like this is for something greater, I need you.

I want a route map from every one that starts from knowing innerself in a vast way. One should travel in a direction of knowing innerself and gaining knowledge so that he develops his identity, basic identity, being an Indian, being a human being, being a truth seeker, a knowledge sekker.

This is just a basic idea what I have givenn to you guys.
I have a lot in my mind eventually everything will come up.

Why not thrive for more, Let's create a chain of flow of information that society needs. We Need.
