Every Team Should Have a Motto, A Slogan of their own.
Our Motto is to be Deeply infused with Knowledge.

One thing must be remembered always that is:
"SKY IS THE LIMIT".

Today is Sunday, So All of you must be waking up late from your bed, picking up your phone swiping through some notification, having breakfast and then listing to some music, or checking stock Market.

But did you guys ever wake up in the morning and after freshning up yourself, think about what you'll do today????

Some Set of parameters we all have to follow to stay committed to this project i.e
-We have to dedicate 1 hr from your 24 hrs
-We have to wake up at one time sharp everyday without any exception.

So Everyday we need a task, so that we'll engage in infusing knowledge into ourselves.

Let's Start with an Intro of ourselves, it dosen't need to be short, you can write whatever you want.

Then our task will be to point out each and every phrase, it's meaning, we'll research every word from our own Intro.

Every disscussion needs to be organised.
I have thought of a guideline.

1. Everyday I'll log one document regarding our weekly research.
2. Every week we'll deliver a ppt and share in skye, we all have to give a presentation to the team regarding the research.
3. Then we'll prepare weekly log.
4. Everyone needs to connect on a platform, I prefer Skype.
5. Whatever disscussion requires daily, It should be done via whatsapp group. But when one is delivering his message, a thought he should not be interrupted.

IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO CONTACT WITH EVERYONE DAILY BUT EVERYDAY PROGRESS SHOULD BE LOGGED IN YOUR OWN SYSTEM.

WEEKLY EVERY DOCUMENT WILL BE UPLOADED INTO THE REPOSITORY.

REMEMBER ONE THING: 
MOST OF THE THINGS WHATEVER WE LIKE IS A REPETATIVE FEED WHAT HAS BEEN GIVEN TO YOU. 

AND THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT YOU ACTUALLY LIKE.
IN THIS PROCESS WE ALL WILL FIND OUT WHAT WE ACTUALLY LIKE.
