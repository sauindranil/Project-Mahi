Hi guys, I am Indranil Sau, a believer, born and brought up at Burdwan, in West Bengal. I am from a Hindu Family, a nuclear family. In the past I was living with my mom, dad and elder brother, and I miss them now because I am Staying in Bangalore now, far from my family. So in Bangalore, I am Working in Wipro Technologies as a Project Engineer. I develop application components, webpages, modify application, automate business needs and sometimes I just learn something new sitting in my cubical. From the childhood I am a good student, interested in science, music, animation and comics. Music is the thing which interested me a lot back then, and it still does. Other than music, I like to listen to podcasts, read stories, maybe short-novels. I think a lot, work on my thoughts, aims to be productive. I am a Electrical Engineer, so from the core I am not a software guy, so out of many confusion, out of the discussions, out of the presure of my own world that I know, I have decided that I would like to do something in my background. I also want to deliver a vision into the society that each and every human being in earth has potential and if we do not encourage, push, challenge the individuals, they will fall. My Strengths are my family, my friends, my love. Without them I am not who I am now. People say I am a jolly Person, maybe yes, I think I am.
